This README provides an overview of the repository's structure, contents, and guidelines for use.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories, each corresponding to a specific category of machine learning techniques:

1. Data_Preprocessing: Contains scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation processes essential for preparing datasets for modeling.

2. Regression_Models: Includes implementations of various regression algorithms, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularized regression techniques.

3. Classification_Models: Features code for classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

4. Clustering_Models: Provides implementations of clustering techniques including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.

5. Association_Rule_Learning: Contains code for algorithms related to association rule learning, such as the Apriori algorithm and Eclat.

6. Dimensionality_Reduction: Includes techniques for reducing the dimensionality of data, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

7. Reinforcement_Learning: Features implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning, SARSA, and policy gradient methods.

8. Natural_Language_Processing: Contains projects focused on natural language processing (NLP), including text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

9. Deep_Learning: Provides implementations of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers.

10. Model_Selection: Includes techniques for model evaluation and selection, such as cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning.
